              IR Insight Mobile is a mobile version of IR Insight. Working with another product designer, we collaborated closely with the desktop team to provide an enhanced view on mobile phones and tablets. In this 12-month project, we worked with a product manager to evaluate all data and metadata and filter out valuable information for our personas who are investor relations officers and administrators.

            <p>
              With a lot of wordsmithing and filtering, we focus on the content layout to optimize metadata. We work closely with the desktop team, and designs and content changes frequently, and we try to emulate the latest designs as much as possible. It was very important for both the mobile and desktop versions to be nearly exact as if the two products were built by one designer instead of two design teams.

              All about the Refinements. The designs go through design and product management reviews before they are shown to the actual clients for feedback. With the lead product researcher, I conducted usability testing with clients in North America and Europe.
