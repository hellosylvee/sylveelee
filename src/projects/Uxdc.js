              I produced multiple assets for the UXDC conference logo that are to be used in various formats. I readjusted the font colors and sizes in logo, small, medium, and large formats.

            <Header as='h3'>Presentation</Header>
            <p>
              I designed and produced speaker slides. The photos sent by the speakers were in different sizes and photo quality. I retouched the photos to be all black and white to give the slides a more uniform look. Information were added on the slides to provide attendees a quick information of the speaker.

            <p>
              I contributed visuals and content in the UXDC blog. I interviewed Scott Berkun who was one of the keynote speakers at the conference. In addition, I also interviewed with Chris Gielow who talked about building design presence in the corporate world, and also Michelle Kirby, who talked about having a voice at the big table.

              One of the bigger tasks as a designer and volunteer for this conference is creating a digital press kit. The main purposes of this kit is to promote the conference and increase ticket sales.
