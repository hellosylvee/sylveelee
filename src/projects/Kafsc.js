               Advocacy for KAFSC is an advocacy fund project for KAFSC, to raise awareness on domestic violence and solicit discretionary funds from council members of New York City. KAFSC is a community-based, nonprofit organization that offers assistance to Korean American families and domestic violence victims in greater New York area. I promote domestic violence awareness, generate funds for the nonprofit organization, and work with executive board members to organize events framing from races to spring formal for young professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project was deemed a success as funding increased 105% for fiscal year 2018, and obtained more funding from new councilmembers.
