              With an open mind, I looked into the stakeholder's idea, by downloading a competitor's prescription-scanning app. The experience was underwhelming as it was unable to scan the bottle accurately. Meanwhile, I was curious about people's thoughts on prescriptions and how they got them refilled. So I reached out to people for interviews on Craigslist and social media. From the interviews, we heard similar pains and needs; people were:
            </p>
            <p>
              The results from the first round of interviews were subpar because I didn't have the right target group. So for the second, I screened for people through a detailed survey with open-ended questions, and this dramatically improved quality in interview answers. From the interviews, noticeable trends bubbled up such as people:
            </p>
            <List bulleted>
              <List.Item>Bought insurance at time of phone purchase/upgrade</List.Item>
              <List.Item>Were unaware that insurance can be bought outside of carriers</List.Item>
              <List.Item>Preferred monthly payments to 1-year payment</List.Item>
              <List.Item>Felt frustrated and annoyed when they filed a claim</List.Item>
              <List.Item>Have a dependent attachment to their phones</List.Item>
            </List>

            <Header as='h3'>Framing</Header>
            <p>
              Our sample group mentioned an attachment to their phones, and felt "naked" without them. Oddly enough, they opt-out of insurance to cut costs. Some angrily canceled their insurance after filing a claim because they had to pay a deductible in order for their phones to be replaced. This cognitive dissonance sparked an interesting design challenge:

            <Header className='pull-quote'>"How might we provide clear, informative insurance plans that are affordable for money-conscious people?"</Header>
            <p>
              Along with the rest of the project team, I generated as many solution ideas to answer this question. The ideas are usually open-ended, not specific components in the product. All ideas (written in post-its) were "synthesized", a process in which ideas are categorized by themes. There were many ideas that range from interaction design to process, so I prioritized them based on a simple question: "Does this solution solve a user need?"
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, I drafted a rough prototype to validate this solution through concept testing, a similar form of testing with focus on concept feedback instead of usability's.

            <Header as='h3'>Working in Iterations</Header>
            <p>
              I worked closely with a product manager to assess and prioritize opportunities and constraints. For upcoming features, I faciliated sketching sessions called design studios to frame a problem in a scenario and sketch ideas on paper. This activity provided collaboration with all members in the project team and partake ownership in designs of the product.

Nexion Mobile provides 3 protection plans with various coverages: Cracked Screen, Serious Malfunction, and Complete Damage. All 3 plans provide monthly or one-time payment options. After a successful payment, a customer can activate the protection plan by downloading a diagnostics app that checks for software and hardware qualities.
